# 2024-2025 Monthly Maintenance Downtime Schedule

The following is a tentative maintenance downtime scheduled for the 2024-2025 academic year and the fall 2025 semester.  The majority of maintenance outages are held on the last Tuesday of each month but some may be moved to accommodate holidays or the academic calendar.  

Please note: This schedule can, and likely will change, to respond to vendor software updates, critical security patches released off-schedule, or unplanned problems.  We will update this page as soon as any decisions are made that affect the schedule.  Thank you for your understanding!  

!!! Danger "FACULTY CLUSTER USERS"
    Jobs on the faculty cluster are allowed to run up until the downtime starts.  Please ensure your jobs checkpoint and can restart where they left off OR request only enough time to run your job prior to the 7am cutoff.
