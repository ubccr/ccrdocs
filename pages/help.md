# CCR Help  

CCR staff provide the majority of support to users via our [TeamDynamix client portal](https://ubuffalo.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/55/Portal/Home/).  The fastest way to receive technical assistance from our team of system administrators and computational scientists is to submit a ticket through the [CCR Help Desk Portal](https://ubuffalo.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/55/Portal/Home/) or by sending an email to ccr-help_at_buffalo.edu which automatically creates a ticket for you.

**Response times:**  Urgent requests sent during regular business hours are often able to be handled within several hours. One of our staff members will respond within 3 business days (often less) to requests for other non-urgent matters. Our system administrators rotate through an on-call schedule for weekends and non-business hours to handle emergency service outages.

**Please do NOT email our staff members directly.**  We rotate ticket duties during business hours to balance our workloads so it's important to have all requests in our ticketing system.  The first available staff member with the proper skillset will respond to you.  We make every effort to provide you with assistance in a timely manner.  

**Phone support:**  CCR does not provide phone support at this time.  Requests for assistance should be submitted via our [help desk](#ccr-help-portal).

!!! Note     
    **Regular Business Hours:** Monday-Friday 8:30am-4:30pm EST   
    **Weekends, Holidays* & After Hours Support:** Emergency assistance provided for major service outages only  
    *CCR follows the [University at Buffalo holiday calendar](https://www.buffalo.edu/administrative-services/ub-calendar.html)   

**Alerts & Important Notices:** We post alerts and [downtime schedules](changelogs/downtime-schedule.md) on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/ubccr) and in [Slack](#slack).  Crucial information affecting all users will be emailed to you.

## CCR Help Portal  

The [TeamDynamix client portal](https://ubuffalo.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/55/Portal/Home/) provides CCR staff and our users the ability to manage requests for support and services. The majority of the services in the CCR service catalog are open to anyone to submit a request.  If you are a UB user, we recommend you login to the portal to see all services available to you, as there are some that are restricted to logged in users. 


### Login to CCR Help Portal  

To login, click the `Login` button at the top right of the [client portal homepage](https://ubuffalo.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/55/Portal/Home/) and use your UB credentials to login.  If you do not have a UB account, you will not be able to login and view tickets.  You should reply via email to update your ticket.  


### Create a new support ticket  

Though users can continue to submit tickets via email to CCR Help, we encourage everyone to fill out the appropriate ticket submission form in the portal.  These forms were designed to gather the most appropriate information for your issue and route it to the right group of staff to help resolve it.  The more information you can provide to our staff, the faster we will be able to help with your problem.  When using the submission forms, users can attach files such as screenshots to better aid our team.  

!!! Danger  
    **DO NOT INCLUDE ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (such as social security numbers) OR PASSWORDS!** 


### Replying to ticket responses  

 You will receive an automated email when a new ticket is received indicating the ticket number and a link to view it online in the portal.  You may reply to us in the portal, if you have a UB account, or by replying to the email.  

### Viewing your tickets (for UB users only) 

Users logged into the portal have the ability to view information about their tickets.  Click on the `View Your Tickets` button on the portal home page and then click on the ticket title of the one you'd like to view.  You will see all correspondence you've sent and all replies by CCR staff.  You will also see which staff member has been assigned the ticket and what the status of the ticket is.  Within this section, you can reply to the ticket, provide additional information to CCR staff, and add attachments.  By default, only tickets in the `new`, `in process`, or `on hold` statuses are displayed.  To view tickets that have been `completed` or `cancelled`, click on the `Status Class` filter to select these options.  If you feel your ticket has been resolved or you no longer have a problem, you can close it yourself by clicking on the `Withdraw Request` button.  

!!! Tip  
    Though you can reply to a closed ticket, we would appreciate it if users would only do this if the original problem has not been solved.  If you have a new problem or are seeing the original problem crop up again, please open a new ticket.  


### Submitting tickets through OnDemand  

OnDemand users also have the ability to submit tickets directly from the OnDemand portal.  If creating a ticket from a job card, additional information about your job setup, resource requests, and other useful information gets included in the ticket.  This is an excellent option when troubleshooting problems as it provides CCR staff much more detailed information.  For more information on this, please refer to the [OnDemand documentation](portals/ood.md#help).


### Surveys  

When your tickets are closed (either by you or by a CCR support agent), you will receive an email indicating this and you may be selected to complete a survey.  We value your opinion and aim to provide the best support possible to all users.  Thank you very much for providing us feedback and we hope we can meet your expectations for excellent and responsive support!  

## Slack  

CCR staff are also available on Slack to handle basic questions and update users on system issues or changes.  While we can't guarantee immediate response times, we are generally available during regular business hours Monday - Friday 8am-4pm.  If your questions involve a lot of time or investigation on our part or are very specific to your workflow, we will ask you to submit a ticket so that we can properly prioritize the request and assign it to the right staff member to help you.  Anyone with a UB email address can join the CCR slack organization using [this invite](https://join.slack.com/t/ubccr-help/shared_invite/zt-qt0clqap-9TsWK~DRL26lGgPRDYfWfA).  External CCR users, please contact CCR Help and we'll gladly invite you!
